# POS CafeLux - Supabase Migration Guide

This guide will help you migrate your POS CafeLux application from the Replit Neon database to Supabase.

## Prerequisites

1. A Supabase account (sign up at https://supabase.com)
2. Your POS CafeLux application files
3. Access to your Supabase project dashboard

## Step 1: Create Supabase Project

1. Go to https://supabase.com and sign in
2. Click "New Project"
3. Choose your organization
4. Enter project details:
   - **Name**: `pos-cafelux`
   - **Database Password**: Create a strong password (save this!)
   - **Region**: Choose closest to your location
5. Click "Create new project"
6. Wait for the project to be created (2-3 minutes)

## Step 2: Get Supabase Credentials

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to **Settings** â†’ **API**
2. Copy the following values:
   - **Project URL**: `https://[your-project-ref].supabase.co`
   - **Project Reference**: The part after `https://` and before `.supabase.co`
   - **anon public key**: Long string starting with `eyJ...`
   - **service_role key**: Long string starting with `eyJ...`

3. Go to **Settings** â†’ **Database**
4. Copy the **Connection string** â†’ **URI**
   - It looks like: `postgresql://postgres:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@db.[PROJECT-REF].supabase.co:5432/postgres`

## Step 3: Run Database Migration

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to **SQL Editor**
2. Click "New query"
3. Copy the entire content from `supabase-migration.sql` file
4. Paste it into the SQL editor
5. Click "Run" to execute the migration
6. You should see: "POS CafeLux database migration completed successfully!"

## Step 4: Configure Your Application

1. Copy `.env.supabase` to `.env`:
   ```bash
   copy .env.supabase .env
   ```

2. Edit `.env` file and replace the placeholders:
   ```env
   # Replace [YOUR-SUPABASE-PASSWORD] with your database password
   # Replace [YOUR-PROJECT-REF] with your project reference
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:YOUR_ACTUAL_PASSWORD@db.YOUR_PROJECT_REF.supabase.co:5432/postgres
   
   # Replace with your actual Supabase values
   SUPABASE_URL=https://YOUR_PROJECT_REF.supabase.co
   SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_actual_anon_key
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_actual_service_role_key
   
   NODE_ENV=development
   PORT=5000
   SESSION_SECRET=change-this-to-a-random-secret-key
   ```

## Step 5: Test the Connection

1. Stop your current development server (Ctrl+C)
2. Start the server again:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. You should see:
   ```
   Starting database seeding...
   Database already seeded, skipping...
   serving on port 5000
   ```

4. Open http://localhost:5000 in your browser
5. Verify that:
   - Dashboard loads with data
   - Products page shows the migrated products
   - You can create new transactions

## Step 6: Verify Data Migration

Check that all data was migrated correctly:

### Users Table
- Should have 1 admin user
- Username: `admin`, Password: `admin123`

### Products Table
- Should have 8 products:
  - Roti Tawar Sari Roti (RTW001)
  - Susu Ultra 1L (SUL001)
  - Indomie Goreng (IMG001)
  - Teh Botol Sosro (TBS001)
  - Sabun Mandi Lifebuoy (SML001)
  - Beras Premium 5kg (BRP001)
  - Minyak Goreng Tropical 2L (MGT001)
  - Gula Pasir 1kg (GPS001)

### Categories Table
- Should have 7 categories:
  - Makanan, Minuman, Snack, Sembako, Personal Care, Kesehatan, Rumah Tangga

### Customers Table
- Should have 5 sample customers

## Step 7: Configure Supabase Security (Optional)

For production use, you may want to configure Row Level Security (RLS) policies:

1. Go to **Authentication** â†’ **Policies** in Supabase dashboard
2. Review the automatically created policies
3. Modify them based on your security requirements

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- Verify your DATABASE_URL is correct
- Check that your database password doesn't contain special characters that need URL encoding
- Ensure your IP is allowed (Supabase allows all IPs by default)

### Migration Errors
- If you get "table already exists" errors, the tables were created successfully
- If you get permission errors, make sure you're using the correct credentials

### Application Errors
- Check the console for detailed error messages
- Verify all environment variables are set correctly
- Make sure the database connection is working

## Success Indicators

âœ… **Migration Successful** when you see:
- No database connection errors in console
- Dashboard shows correct data
- Products page displays all 8 products
- You can create new transactions
- Data persists after server restart

## Next Steps

After successful migration:
1. Update your production environment variables
2. Set up proper authentication (if needed)
3. Configure backup strategies
4. Set up monitoring and alerts
5. Consider implementing proper user authentication

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the Supabase logs in your dashboard
2. Review the application console for errors
3. Verify all environment variables are correct
4. Ensure the migration script ran completely
